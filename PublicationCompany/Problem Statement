Imagine a publishing company that markets both books and video-cassettes versions of its work. 
Write a console-based application to manage the company's repository of books and tapes. 
The application should allow the company owner to perform following tasks:

1. Publish new book
3. List all book publications ordered by publish date in descending order
2. Publish new tape
4. List top 5 publications of current year based on rating
5. Remove all publications which are 5 years old
